**Short description**

This is the repository for the Ancesta web app (www.ancesta.uk) that allows to visualise complex family trees of 
famous people using data from WikiData.

Note that since the website is hosted on a Heroku dyno, it could take up to 30 seconds to open the website.

This is a third-year SED project at Imperial College London

**Dependencies**

The most notable backend dependencies include:
- Heroku - hosting
- KTOR - API requests routing
- WikiData - data source

The most notable frontend dependencies include:
- JS + ReactJS - framework
- GoJS - diagram rendering

**Licenses**

Throughout the development of the project, the Evaluation License of the GoJS library was used.
Should the project be extended / commercialised the Development and Distribution License would need to 
be purchased or an alternative open-source library would need to be found.

**Running the project locally**

To run the backend open the repository in IntelliJ IDEA, set the necessary environmental variables and run Application.kt.

To run the frontend navigate to genealogy-f and run ```npm install``` then ```npm run dev```.
